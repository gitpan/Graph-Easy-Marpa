- Allow spaces in graph definitions, by expanding the regexps in the state transition table.
- Add more sample data, as data/*.raw (for input to the lexer) and data/*.cooked (as output from the lexer
and input to the parser).
- Adopt Set::Array instead of manually managing some arrayrefs.
- Ensure all major methods (normally run() ) return 0 for success and 1 for failure, and that test code does too.
- Switch from Moose to Hash::FieldHash, to make the code more light-weight.
- Implement scripts/generate.index.pl to create a web page with embedded Graph::Easy files and corresponding *.svg files.
