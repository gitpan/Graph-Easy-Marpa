Comments= <<EOT
- Implement subgraphs (i.e. groups), classes and subclasses. See the FAQ for notes on group attributes.
- Put a copy of the CSV version of the STT in the __DATA__ section of the lexer, to speed up reading it.
- Support the rankdir option for the graph as a whole.
- Support the directed option for the graph as a whole.
- In Graph::Easy::Marpa::Lexer, use the timeout feature to ensure the DFA does not loop forever.
- In Graph::Easy::Marpa::Lexer, make OpenOffice::OODoc optional, and only load it if the user specifies *.ods
for the STT file.
- In Graph::Easy::Marpa::Lexer, add verbose to the list of keys accepted by new().
- In Graph::Easy::Marpa::Renderer::GraphViz2, handle cases where the graph definition starts or ends with an edge,
or a daisy chain of edges.
- In Graph::Easy::Marpa, add a new section to the docs, Methods, where all public methods are documented.
These are the same as the parameters to new(), along with log() and run().
- In other modules, update the lists of keys acceptable to new(), and the corresponding method docs.
- Allow an object of type Graph::Easy::Marpa to pass a logger object to objects of type Graph::Easy::Marpa::Lexer
and of type Graph::Easy::Marpa::Parser, along with the corresponding values for maxlevel and minlevel.
- Use Date::Format to add a date stamp at the end of html/index.html, as output by generate.index.pl.
- Extend demo with data/edge.08.raw, which show various arrow heads, and many class and subgraphs samples too.
- Export the STT (cvs file) as data/default.stt.html. The version shipped with 0.91 was not up-to-date.

[V 0.91]

Comments=- Update pre-requisites. Set::FA 1.05 -> 1.06. Add File::Spec, File::Basename, GraphViz2.

[V 0.90]
Date=2011-06-28T12:18:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Allow spaces in graph definitions, by expanding the regexps in the state transition table.
- Add more sample data, as data/*.raw (for input to the lexer) and data/*.cooked (as output from the lexer
and input to the parser).
- Adopt Set::Array instead of manually managing some arrayrefs.
- Ensure all major methods (normally run() ) return 0 for success and 1 for failure, and that test code does too.
- Switch from Moose to Hash::FieldHash, to make the code more light-weight.
- Implement scripts/generate.index.pl to create a web page with embedded Graph::Easy files and corresponding *.svg files.
- Upload demo to http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/graph.easy.marpa/index.html.

[V 0.60]
Date=2011-05-14T11:16:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Implement basic Graph::Easy::Marpa::Lexer to read raw Graph::Easy files.
- Change Graph::Easy::Marpa::Test.run() to test_parser(), and implement test_lexer().
- Change Graph::Easy::Marpa::Test to accept file name not file number.
- Add various test files in data/ and t/.
- Add scripts/graph.30.sh to show how to feed the lexer's output to the parser.
