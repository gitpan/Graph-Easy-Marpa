Revision history for Perl extension Graph::Easy::Marpa.

0.91  Wed Jun 29 11:41:00 2011
	  - Update pre-requisites. Set::FA 1.05 -> 1.06. Add File::Spec, File::Basename, GraphViz2.

0.90  Tue Jun 28 12:18:00 2011
	  - Allow spaces in graph definitions, by expanding the regexps in the state transition table.
	  - Add more sample data, as data/*.raw (for input to the lexer) and data/*.cooked (as output from the lexer
	  	and input to the parser).
	  - Adopt Set::Array instead of manually managing some arrayrefs.
	  - Ensure all major methods (normally run() ) return 0 for success and 1 for failure, and that test code does too.
	  - Switch from Moose to Hash::FieldHash, to make the code more light-weight.
	  - Implement scripts/generate.index.pl to create a web page with embedded Graph::Easy files and corresponding *.svg files.
	  - Upload demo to http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/graph.easy.marpa/index.html.
